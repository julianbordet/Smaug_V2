# Smaug 2.0

Smaug 2.0 is a react front end SPA app that I developed/remade using my previous Smaug SSR MVC project as reference. 

Version 2 features:
  - Uses react-router for routing.
  - Uses redux for global state update/handling.
  - Makes async CURD calls to a backend REST API that I also developed (Erebor) for get/put/post/delete requests.
  - Makes use of most of react's hooks.
